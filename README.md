### Hello! 👋 

My name is Paul Ramirez and I am a software engineer with a background in 🏃🏽 physical therapy , 🎥 video production , and 📸 photography. 
I have experience working with JavaScript, React, Redux, Ruby on Rails, Node, Express, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. I am currently seeking out software engineering positions that will put me in a position to create exciting projects that can positively impact people's lives everywhere.

When I'm not coding, I love to spend my time rocking out on my guitar 🎸, collecting sneakers 👟, playing basketball 🏀, and snowboarding 🏂 .

Let's get in touch!
